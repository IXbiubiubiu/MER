Androsterone derivatives for inhibiting dna binding of ap-1 and airway smooth muscle proliferation  There is provided a method for the use of the adrenal steroid dehydroepiandrosterone and certain of its analogs to reduce growth of immortalized and malignant cell lines. Dehydroepiandrosterone and its potent analogs 16.alpha.-bromo-5-androsten-17-one, 16.beta.-bromo-5-androsten-17-one, 16.alpha.-fluoro-5-androsten-17-one, 16.beta.-fluoro-5-androsten-17-one, 16.alpha.-bromo-5-androstan-17-one, 16.beta.-bromo-5-androstan-17-one, 16.alpha.-fluoro-5-androstan-17-one, and 16.beta.-fluoro-5-androstan-17-one impair activation of secondary growth response genes and thus prove useful for treatment of asthmatic airway remodellina in man. 2-hydroxybutyric acid
