Files used to extract list of terms from original data formats.

It's not possible to run the scripts from here, since the source data files are not in this folder.

The code used to extract chemical data is not here. Terms of HMDB, ChEBI and ChEMBL were simply extracted from [here](http://www.biosemantics.org/index.php/resources/non-systematic-chemical-identifiers) and joined in one file.
